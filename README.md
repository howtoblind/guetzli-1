Guetzli, A deliciously fast and simple Filesystem-Web-CMS
=========================================================

Guetzli came about when we became too frustrated with Wordpress and its cesspool of plugins constantly breaking each other just to provide basic features like backups and multilingual pages. Guetzli is

1) Insanely simple. It's written in less than 300 lines of Python Flask.

2) Powerful. Add as many pages and languages as you like by editing the content directory using favourite local file editor, no server restarts required. Even changing the template or the configuration doesn't require a restart. Need to rollout to production? Just git push & pull, rollout done.

3) Fast.  On a 2012 Macbook Pro with SSD it's doing 400-500 requests per second *just using the single threaded Flask toy server*. Multi-threaded wsgi-servers on a decent VPS will be even happier with Guetzli.

What's with the name? 'Guetzli' is the Swiss German word for cookie. It's a good metaphor for this CMS, since it's small, quickly digested and comes with [biscuit](docs/documentation.md#the-biscuit) and [chocolate](docs/documentation.md#the-chocolate).

Setup
-----
1) Clone this repo and `cd` into it.

2) `sudo pip install Flask pystache`.

3) Feed guetzli to the python: `python ./server.py`.

4) Enjoy on localhost:5000 or [Your-Devserver-URL]:5000 in case your server can be reached from the outside. For a production ready deployment, please see [Going Live!](docs/documentation.md#going-live)

Design Principles
-----------------
1) No Database! The filesystem is more than enough for a simple multi-page web appearance.

2) File changes need to be reflected in the next request.

3) Nevertheless, hit the file system the least amount possible - use file modification dates and in-memory cache to do the least amount of File I/O possible.

4) Cache the result of all potentially expensive operations (like json.loads or even regex matches).

Features
--------
1) Localized posts, e.g. blogging.

2) Automatic reloading of modified resources on the next request, including `content/config.json`. You should never have to restart this server.

2) Full multilanguage support. Add as many languages as you like by editing `content/config.json` and add the linked pages in language-subfolders under `content/pages` (see the example in the repo). Guetzli will match the one that best represents the client's request header and lists the other options just in case.

3) Mustache templating - in the template, pages and posts.

4) Localized strings, defined in `content/config.json`.

5) Redirect to (localized) default page if a page can't be found.

6) All URL params are checked to only contain letters, numbers, underscores and dashes (which is also the restriction for the page filenames) - no funny business in your file system!
